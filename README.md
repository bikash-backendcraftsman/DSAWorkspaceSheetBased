# 🧠 DSAWorkspaceSheetBased

A structured **Java-based Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** workspace designed to practice and implement concepts from **Striver’s A2Z Sheet** and **Crio DSA modules**, focusing on **problem-solving, optimization, and clean code practices**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Organized topic-wise DSA problems (Arrays, Strings, Two Pointers, HashMaps, etc.)
- ⚙️ Implemented in **Java 8+** using **Streams**, **Lambda Expressions**, and **Functional Interfaces**
- 🧩 Follows clean coding principles and modular design
- 🧠 Progressive approach: from brute-force → optimized → edge-case handling
- 🧪 Includes test-ready methods for future integration with JUnit

Would you like me to make it more **branded** around your “**BackendCraftsman**” identity (with logo-style title, Korean proverb slogan, and personal tagline)? It’ll make your repo stand out professionally on GitHub.
